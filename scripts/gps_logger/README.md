Configuring the GPS
===================
In order to use the GPS and GPS logger correct, the GPS needs to be properly
configured.  To configure the GPS, install the Ublox u-center software on a 
Windows machine.  Connect to the GPS in the u-center software, then apply the
configuration settings in UBX_CFG.txt.
